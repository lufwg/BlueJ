It is discussed in chapter 1.
    
This is a very simple project to demonstrate some characteristics of
objects.

This project is often used after studying the "shapes" project. It
adds a class to those ones in "shapes". That class (named "Picture")
uses the shapes to draw a picture. It can be used to experiment with 
modifying source code.

Exercise 1.15 Challenge exercise (This means that this exercise might not be
solved quickly. We do not expect everyone to be able to solve this at the moment. If
you do – great. If you don’t, then don’t worry. Things will become clearer as you read
on. Come back to this exercise later.) Add a sunset to the single-sun version of
Picture. That is: make the sun go down slowly. Remember: The circle has a method
slowMoveVertical that you can use to do this.

Exercise 1.16 Challenge exercise If you added your sunset to the end of the
draw method (so that the sun goes down automatically when the picture is drawn),
change this now. We now want the sunset in a separate method, so that we can call
draw and see the picture with the sun up, and then call sunset (a separate method!)
to make the sun go down.
